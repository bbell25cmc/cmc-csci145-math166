I have purchased print versions of the textbook for everyone in class.
If you prefer an electronic copy, you can download one at <https://annas-archive.org/md5/0a99f8c39b197c6ecad82761bcdb4176>.

For next week:
1. I strongly recommend reading the first chapter.
1. I realize that midterm studying will take priority.
   
   For the midterm:

   * If your midterm grade is greater than either of your previous quiz grades, I will replace your quiz grade with the miderm grade.

   * This can apply to both quizzes.

   Recall:

   * The midterm is designed to prepare you for technical interviews

   * Machine learning engineers get paid more than SWEs or generic data scientists

1. Pagerank coding deadline extended to Sunday 29 September

    I still recommend completing it early, since it will help you study for the midterm.

    If you have to choose between completing the homework or studying for the midterm,
    choose studying for the midterm.

1. I am open to having a dedicated office hours this Friday for midterm prep.

    To get this: I need someone to post a github issue, and at least 3 other students to confirm on github that they would attend.

**Monday 2024-09-23:**

1. I am open to offering extra exam-prep office hours tomorrow (Tuesday) from 11am-12pm.

    For me to do this, I need a github issue posted asking for it and at least 3 other students replying that they will attend.

1. Don't forget to practice on the whiteboard!

1. We will go at a "slow" pace today, since everyone is preoccupied with pagerank/exam stuff.

1. I will draw on blank pages not part of the notes.
